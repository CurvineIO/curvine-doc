## Core Feature Planning

### 1. Cache function improvement
- [ ] Cache data automatic cleanup
- [ ] Support mainstream storage systemsï¼š
    - HDFS
    - S3
    - OSS (OSS-HDFS)
- [ ] Cache data preloading

### 2. Data write consistency
- [ ] Write data automatically manages cache and refreshes to storage systems
- [ ] Pipeline multi-replica copy and maintenance
- [ ] Strong consistency protocol support

### 3. Shuffle support
- [ ] File aggregation function
- [ ] Integration with Spark RSS (Remote Shuffle Service)

### 4. Performance optimization
- [ ] ORPC uses `io_uring` to implement full-link zero-copy (solving the `splice` failure problem in cloud environments)
- [ ] FUSE full-link zero-copy (performance alignment with Client mode)
- [ ] RDMA network support

### 5. Cloud-native support
- [ ] Curvine Operator
- [ ] Curvine CSI driver
